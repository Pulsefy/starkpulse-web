- [ ] Initialize Cairo project with dependencies
- [ ] Create basic project structure and files

### Phase 2: Core Smart Contract (3 hours)
- [ ] Implement NewsItem and UserProfile data structures
- [ ] Create news submission and retrieval functions
- [ ] Implement voting system with anti-spam protection
- [ ] Add token reward calculation and distribution
- [ ] Implement user reputation tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 hour)
- [ ] Add content moderation functionality
- [ ] Implement access control for admin functions
- [ ] Create event emissions for all actions
- [ ] Add configuration management (reward rates, etc.)

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (0.5 hours)
- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for testnet/mainnet
- [ ] Add interaction scripts for contract management
- [ ] Create documentation and setup guides

**Estimated Time: 6 hours**

## Technical Considerations 🤔

### Architecture Decisions
- **Smart Contract Language**: Cairo for StarkNet compatibility
- **Development Framework**: Scarb for package management and building
- **Testing Framework**: Built-in Cairo testing capabilities
- **Deployment**: Python scripts with starknet-py for automation
